# Jeffr 

Jeffr is a simple, single-page, Jeff Goldblum-themed Twitter clone. The original requirements for this project asked us to develop a SPA twitter clone, however left much of the styling up to us. As any sane person would do, I took this as an opportunity to demonstrate the greatness of Jeff Goldblum.
