# Jeffr 

Jeffr is a simple, single-page, Jeff Goldblum-themed Twitter clone. The original requirements for this project asked us to develop a SPA twitter clone, however left much of the styling up to us. As any sane person would do, I took this as an opportunity to demonstrate the greatness of Jeff Goldblum.

## Extra Features

In addition to the requirements, the user-helper file has been modified to generate random Jeffs as demo users instead of the normal random users! The first name is always Jeff, their handle is always @JeffX where 'X' is a random integer, and their profile picture is randomly selected from a pool of wonderful Jeff pictures. Enjoy the Jeffness!
